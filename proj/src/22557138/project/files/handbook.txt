Section One INTRODUCTION A. Hong Kong College of Technology
The Hong Kong College of Technology (“HKCT/College”), formerly known as the Mongkok Workers’ Night School, was founded in 1957 as a non-profit making education institute offering students and in-service workers alternate routes to obtain recognized professional qualifications when places in tertiary education were limited.
HKCT has years of experience in the delivery of education programmes and the provision of education services in Hong Kong. Over the years, HKCT has successfully introduced various internationally recognized vocational qualifications to cater for local demand of study. Currently, we are offering a wide range of vocational and professional programmes, alongside with over 30 higher education programmes.
B. Undergraduate & Postgraduate Degree Programmes
Since 1997, HKCT has been collaborating with overseas universities to offer non-local programmes from undergraduate to master’s degree levels for Hong Kong students. A wide spectrum of programmes including engineering, construction, facilities management, property management, creative media & design, accounting, computer, business and psychology are offered with recognition from different professional bodies. Over the past two decades, HKCT has nurtured over 3,000 graduates in the above disciplines. Most graduates had attained professional qualifications subsequent to their study and engaged in professional practice.
C. Sub-degree Programmes
Since 2001, HKCT has successfully gained accreditation status from the Hong Kong Council for Accreditation of Academic and Vocational Qualifications (“HKCAAVQ”), the successor of the Hong Kong Council for Academic Accreditation to offer sub-degree programmes in the areas of business administration, accounting, computing, tourism and hospitality, social work, art and design, languages, and sports.

Subsidy for students:
The maximum amount of subsidy to be granted to an eligible student for his/her participation in an exchange activity under the SSE varies according to the destination and duration of the exchange activity as set out below:
  (a)
  Destination Subsidy Amount ($)
Destination Subsidy Amount ($)
3,000 7,000 8,000 9,000 15,000
Subsidy Amount ($)

Subsidy for students
- The maximum amount of subsidy to be granted to an eligible student for his/her participation in an exchange activity under the Means-tested SSEBR varies according to the destination and duration of the exchange activity as set out below:
  (a)
  Destination
Asia (including Middle East, excluding the Mainland, Taiwan and Macao)
Subsidy Amount ($)
3,000
7,000
8,000 15,000
Subsidy Amount ($)
3,500
6,000 10,000 25,000 45,000
    Africa
Oceania and Europe
Central and South America and Caribbean
      (b)
  Duration
5 – 13 days 14 – 28 days 29 – 90 days 91 – 180 days Over 180 days
            In general, the duration of an exchange activity should cover the period from the commencement date to the completion date of the official programme of the exchange activity. Travelling time back and forth between Hong Kong and the exchange destination should not be counted towards the duration of the exchange activity.
For each exchange activity, the maximum amount of subsidy to be granted to the student is calculated by adding up the subsidy under (a) and (b) above, then discounted by his/her level of student finance (in terms of percentage of full grant) approved by the SFO. In individual cases where the level of student finance approved by the SFO is lower than 50%, the financial assistance level to be adopted in the calculation of the maximum amount of subsidy for the student under the Means-tested SSEBR should be adjusted upward to 50%. HKCT may, at the full discretion, adjust the actual amount of subsidy to be granted to the student downwards from that maximum amount, having regard to the actual travelling expenses and participation fees involved in the exchange activities, other subsidy/sponsorship received by the student, etc. In principle, the amount of

subsidy granted to an eligible student under the Means-tested SSEBR should not exceed the direct costs arising from his/her participation in the concerned exchange activity.
7.6.4 Each student will only be eligible for assistance under the Means-tested SSEBR twice at most, subject to the maximum amount of subsidy to be received by him/her under the Means-tested SSEBR, i.e. $60,000 discounted by his/her level of student finance approved by the SFO throughout his/her study at the same level (i.e. sub- degree or undergraduate).
7.6.5 HKCT has the discretion to consider whether subsidy under the Means-tested SSEBR should be granted to students who have once received assistance under the Non-means-tested SSEBR, and vice versa during their study in programme(s) at the same level of study in Hong Kong. This is subject to the objectives of the Means-tested SSEBR and Non-means-tested SSEBR being effectively fulfilled and the eligibility criteria.
7.6.6 Priority will be given to those who have not received any subsidy under scholarship/sponsorship/subsidy schemes wholly or partly funded by the Government.

7.7.1 The HKSAR Government has introduced the Continuing Education Fund (“CEF”) to subsidise adults with learning aspirations pursuing continuing education and training.
7.7.2 If the programme/module is a reimbursable course under CEF, the students may consider applying for CEF reimbursement of the tuition fee with the following eligibility.
Applicants for CEF should:
• Be Hong Kong residents who have the right of abode or the right to land or to remain in Hong Kong without restriction, or holders of one-way permit from the Mainland China;
• Be aged between 18 and 70 (i.e. before reaching the age of 71) both at the time when the CEF reimbursable course under application commences and at the time when an application for fee reimbursement is submitted;
• Eligible applicants should complete a reimbursable CEF course. The applicants should fulfil the graduation requirement and, where appropriate, module pass criteria of the concerned CEF course. In addition to fulfilling the graduation/pass criteria of the programme/module, the applicants must have attended no less than 70% of the contactable hours of the CEF reimbursable course or such higher attendance requirement as prescribed for the CEF reimbursable course (whichever is higher) and attained an overall mark of either 50% or such higher percentage of assessment(s) as prescribed for the CEF reimbursable course (whichever is higher) as assessed by whichever method approved by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare (including any examination and assignment requirements with approved weighting). For CEF reimbursement, the contactable hours in the attendance rate refer to the non- assessment hours only. Each CEF course has its own set of “Completion and CEF Reimbursement Requirements” and the applicants should refer to these requirements for details.
• At the time of application, and on seeking reimbursement of the tuition fee, have paid the tuition fee for a CEF reimbursable course; and
• Have not obtained any other publicly-funded financial assistance for the same CEF reimbursable course, module or unit of study credits.
7.7.3 CEF reimbursement only applies to the tuition fee of a CEF reimbursable course. Any other fees in HKCT/CTIHE including, but not limited to, reassessment fee, retake fee and fee for credit transfer/exemption are not reimbursable. Reimbursements may be made in respect of more than one CEF reimbursable course, subject to the maximum entitlement of HK$20,000 per applicant. Upon

successful completion of the CEF course and apply for the CEF reimbursement, the actual reimbursement for each CEF reimbursable course may vary with CEF applicants.
7.7.4 Applicants for CEF are recommended to check against the up-to-date eligibility, reimbursement procedures and related information on the CEF website at www.wfsfaa.gov.hk/cef or contact the CEF enquiry hotline at 3142 2277.
Payment Deferral
Application for deferred payment will be considered only when a student is proven to be in serious financial difficulty. Students in need can approach Department of Student Development for assistance at least SEVEN working days before the deadline for payment of tuition fee. It must be noted that the delay of SFO’s offer will NOT be considered as an acceptable or valid reason for payment deferral.
Subject (or Module) Retake Fee
Students are required to pay a retake fee in case of failing in a subject (or module). For details, please contact the Programme Administration Unit of respective programme.

Section Five IMPORTANT NOTES FOR NON- LOCAL STUDENTS
A. Student Visa
Non-local students will require a student visa/entry permit issued by the Hong Kong Immigration Department to study in Hong Kong. It is the student’s responsibility to obtain a valid student visa/entry permit before arrival, and to comply with the terms and conditions of the visa/entry permit. If they are unable to produce a valid student visa/entry permit which corresponds to the programme they intend to study, they will not be allowed to enrol in HKCT programme. Consult the website of the Hong Kong Immigration Department for details about visa requirements.
All non-local students should abide by the laws of Hong Kong and comply with the“Conditions of stay”as prescribed in Chapter 115A Immigration Regulation: 2 Condition of Stay
(https://www.elegislation.gov.hk/hk/cap115A/s2):
Permission given to a person to land in Hong Kong as a student shall be subject to the following conditions of stay
(a) that he shall become a student only at a specified school, university or other educational institute and undertake such course of study as may be approved by the Director; and
(b) that he shall not
(i) take any employment, whether paid or unpaid; or (ii) establish or join in any business.

B. Immigration Policy on Study
Below are important Questions and Answers extracted from the Immigration Department regarding Immigration Policy on Study (http://www.immd.gov.hk/eng/faq/imm-policy- study.html).
Application Procedures
Q1: What documents are required for me to apply for extension of stay for pursuing the same course of study?
The following documents are normally required when submitting an extension of stay application: (i) a duly completed application form ID 91; (ii) the applicant's travel document; (iii) the applicant's HK Identity Card; and (iv) a letter from the institute confirming that the student requires extension of stay to continue the same study programme and indicating the remaining duration of the study programme and the expected date of graduation.
Extension of Stay
Q2: What is the normal processing time for processing applications for extension of stay?
Individual applications will be finalised within 2 to 3 weeks upon receipt of all necessary documents.
Q3: What are the restrictions for extending my stay in Hong Kong to pursue further studies?
If you have successfully completed a full-time post-secondary programme in Hong Kong, you will normally be allowed to extend your stay to pursue another locally accredited full-time programme at a higher level of study.
For students from the Mainland, Macao and Taiwan, if you cannot complete a full-time programme at either degree or sub-degree level within the normal programme duration, consideration may be given to extend your stay for up to one year so as to complete the programme.If you wish to switch to another locally-accredited full-time programme before completing the earlier one, you will normally be allowed to extend your stay to pursue the new programme unless you would, with such extension, be able to accumulate five years or more of continuous residence in Hong Kong.

Annex C - Student Handbook (2021-22)
Hong Kong College of Technology Student Handbook for Academic Year 2021-22
Change of Educational Institutes/Programmes and Termination of Study
Q4: Can I switch from one programme to another within the same educational institute?
You may apply for switching from one programme to another within the same education institute if you continue to fulfill the eligibility criteria for entry for study. If the change of study programme is approved, you will be informed in writing.
Q5: Can I continue to stay in Hong Kong after termination of my study?
You must leave Hong Kong within 4 weeks from the date of termination of the study. It is an immigration offence for breach of condition of stay if you fail to leave Hong Kong within the prescribed time.
Employment during the Study Programme
Q6: What is the further relaxation of employment restriction for non-local students which comes into effect from 17 March 2014?
Under Regulation 2 of the Immigration Regulations, Cap 115A, permission given to a person to land in Hong Kong as a student shall be subject to the conditions of stay that, inter alia, he/she shall not take any employment, whether paid or unpaid. The restriction in respect of internship and part-time employment for non-local students has been further relaxed from 17 March 2014 onwards. Non-local students of full-time locally-accredited local or non-local programmes at undergraduate level or above whose study period is not less than one academic year may take up internship subject to the following conditions:
i. The internships must be study/curriculum-related and be arranged or endorsed by the institutes they are studying in; and
ii. The duration of the internship is up to one academic year, or one-third of the normal duration of the relevant full-time academic programme, whichever is the shorter.
There is no restriction on the nature of work, level of salary, location, number of working hours and employers for the internship arrangements.
As regards non-local students enrolled in full-time locally-accredited sub-degree local programmes with a study period not less than 2 academic years, they may also apply to take up an internship if the following conditions are met:

Annex C - Student Handbook (2021-22)_Page 77

Annex C - Student Handbook (2021-22)
Hong Kong College of Technology Student Handbook for Academic Year 2021-22
i. the internship must be mandatory, study/curriculum-related and be arranged / endorsed by the institutes they are studying in; and
ii. the duration of the internship is up to 6 months.
Moreover, non-local students (excluding exchange students) of full-time locally-accredited local programmes at undergraduate level or above whose study period is not less than one academic year may, during the currency of their limit of stay take up:
i. part-time on-campus employment for not more than 20 hours per week throughout the year; and
ii. employment during the summer months without any limit in relation to working hours and location.
Q7: The NOL (“No Objection Letter”) for non-local students studying locally-accredited local or non-local programmes at undergraduate level or above to take up internship is valid for one year only. Do I need to submit the application for NOL every year?
In case of need, the student is required to apply for a new NOL for taking up internship in subsequent academic years through the educational institute, subject to the fulfillment of the relevant requirements i.e. (i) the internship must be study/curriculum-related and be arranged or endorsed by the institutes they are studying in; and (ii) the duration of the internship is up to one academic year, or one-third of the normal duration of the relevant full-time academic programme, whichever is the shorter.
Q8: Is the NOL valid for my whole academic programme?
The validity of the NOL for taking up part-time on-campus employment and summer jobs will be in line with the limit of stay granted to the students concerned and will normally cover the whole academic programme. For study/curriculum-related internship for non-local students at undergraduate level of above, the NOL will normally be valid for one year. After the expiry of the existing ones, the students can apply, if required, through their respective institutes for a fresh NOL. As for mandatory and study/curriculum-related internship for non-local students at sub- degree level, the validity of the NOL will depend on individual cases.
Q9: Is the NOL still valid if I have switched to another study programme?
In the event that a non-local student successfully switches to another study programme whether in the same or another institute, the NOL in respect of the previous study programme will cease to be valid. His/her eligibility for study/curriculum-related internship, part-time on-campus employment and summer jobs will be assessed afresh. A new NOL, if applicable, will be issued.

Section Seven STUDENT FEEDBACK POLICY
HKCT welcomes feedback from students for continuous improvement.
1. Students can raise the programme / subject specific opinions through the Student Feedback Questionnaires and /or Programme Committee:
1.1 Students play a crucial part in the evaluation, development and enhancement of quality. Feedback from students is essential for HKCT to identify issues and areas for quality improvement, as well as, good practices. Student feedback is collected through a variety of channels.
1.2 Student representatives are invited to Programme Committee meetings on the agenda of curriculum and teaching and learning. Student representatives collect opinions from their classmates before attending meetings. They are encouraged to express their views on the structure of curriculum and the contents and delivery of subjects. These views and the corresponding follow-up actions are recorded by the Programme Committee and reported in the Annual Programme Report.
1.3 Student Feedback Questionnaire is one of the formal channels to collect student feedback in programme delivery. At the end of each term, students are invited to fill in the questionnaire anonymously for each subject. Data collection is conducted by administrative staff. Findings are forwarded to the subject lecturer, the Head of Programme and the Head of Department for follow-up. The findings are further analysed and summarised by the subject lecturer in the Subject Review Report which is to be submitted to the Head of Programme for inclusion in the Annual Programme Report.
2. Comments / Opinions on non-teaching and learning related services/facilities including campus services and administration can also be raised for attention and discussion in the Staff- Student Consultative Meeting (“SSCM”). SSCM is another feedback mechanism which is held once per term to collect student feedback on administration and campus facilities. Issues raised by student representatives would be addressed and followed up by respective departments as appropriate.
3. Apart from these, informal contacts with Head of Department/Division and Head of Programme are encouraged for better communication.

Student Complaint Procedures
1. HKCT understands that a student may sometimes have unsatisfied expectation about the provision of any programme of study or related facility or any other services provided by the College. In most cases, the shortfall of expectation is mainly resulted from misunderstanding and miscommunication between the student and the Institute. To facilitate mutual understanding and better communication, students can express their expectations that are not satisfied to the staff of the Institute by following the procedures set out in this document.
2. The procedures included in this document do not apply to assessment results. Appeals against assessment results should be made according to the procedures stated in the Regulations.
3. A student who finds his/her expectation not satisfied is advised to consult the staff in the DSD for general advice on the most appropriate way to express their concerns.
4. A student is welcomed to express views and expectations according to the following stages.
Stage 1: Initial Communication
4.1 A student is encouraged to communicate with the staff responsible for the matter which s/he is not satisfied with as early as possible. During the communication, the student can voice out his/her view and expectation and express his/her concerns with any justifiable evidence. The staff will work towards a solution for the student on reasonable grounds.
4.2 At this stage, the matter will normally be handled orally and a written record will not be made.
Stage 2: Formal Complaint
4.3 Whenever a student is dissatisfied with the outcome after the initial communication, s/he can consider a formal complaint in written format and address it to the head of the department relating to the complaint. For instance, a complaint about teaching should be made to the head of the academic department.
4.4 A complainant shall identify himself/herself clearly in the formal complaint no matter the complaint is initiated for his/her own or on behalf of others. An anonymous complaint will not be dealt with.
 88
Annex C - Student Handbook (2021-22)_Page 88

Annex C - Student Handbook (2021-22)
Hong Kong College of Technology Student Handbook for Academic Year 2021-22
4.5 The complainant should include in a formal complaint the details of the nature of such complaint and a statement showing why s/he remains dissatisfied with the solution reached in the initial communication. Ideally, s/he can describe his/her expected outcome(s).
4.6 Upon receiving a formal complaint, the head of the department will take two actions: 1) acknowledge the student that the formal complaint was received within 3 working days; and 2) investigate the information provided by the complainant with various stakeholders. The complainant will be notified in writing the result of the investigation within 15 working days after the receipt of the complaint by the Institute.
Stage 3: Appeal
4.7 If the complainant has reasonable grounds to consider that the complaint has not been adequately addressed upon receipt of the investigation result from the head of the department, s/he can submit an appeal in writing to the Complaints Review Panel (“the Panel”) to consider the case. All members in the Panel are not directly involved in the substance of the complaint and the Panel is appointed by and held accountable to the President. The Panel will make a recommendation to the President who shall determine what action should be taken. The decision made by the Panel shall be final. The complainant will be informed of the final conclusion in writing within 30 working days after the appeal is received by the Panel.
5. The complaint handling procedures mentioned in this document shall be dealt with by all parties concerned in strict confidentiality.
6. The complainant is entitled to be accompanied by a person s/he chooses at any stage in the procedures.
7. Repeated complaints or a series of complaints that are similar in nature, that have already been dealt with or dismissed will not be entertained.
All complaints going through the formal stage and the appeal stage will be reported to the Academic Board by the responsible directorate or presidential grade staff annually as part of the reporting and monitoring process.
